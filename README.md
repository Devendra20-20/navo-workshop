# NASA-NAVO Notebooks

These notebooks demonstrate how to access NASA data through
python. Under the hood, they use Virtual Observatory protocols so that
the user does not need to know where the data are hosted but can
discover what is available and access it in standard ways.

They depend on the python utilities developed by the NAVO to simplify
these queries. At some point, we will package these tools for a proper
distribution, but for the moment, they are under development on a
sibling repository at

https://github.com/NASA-NAVO/aas_workshop_2018_summer

Check out both repositories in different (e.g., adjacent) directories,
and then in your local copy of this notebooks repo, create a link to the other's
navo_utils subdirectory.
